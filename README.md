<b>Tumulus: A Web3 Data Storage & Sharing Solution</b>

Tumulus is the web3 data storage and sharing solution for people who care about data sovereignty. Tumulus harnesses the cryptographic superpowers inherent in web3 to enable users to manage their own data in a truly self-sovereign manner – where it is not in the custody of any third party but is encrypted and stored on IPFS. Tumulus also empowers users to easily compose sophisticated sharing agreements via smart contracts written to blockchain.

'Tumulus' is the Latin word for ‘burial mound’ and we imagine this project as providing a kind of ‘digital burial mound’ constructed using web3 technologies. The guiding use case has been where someone wants to specify their end-of-life wishes in a series of smart contracts that will be triggered after they die. Tumulus guarantees their data will be shared posthumously according to their wishes without having to depend on professional or corporate intermediaries. However, the number of potential use cases for tumulus is boundless and includes use by law firms and notaries, realtors, data rooms for start-ups, community and neighborhood associations, archivists, NFT creators and collectors, NGOs, political organizations, insurance companies, research scientists, and journalists. Our hope is that you will join us in further developing the code while supporting your own novel use cases!

The tumulus project provides everything you need to get started:  the tumulus API (TumulusAPI), the tumulus smart contract (TumulusSmartContract) and a demo application (TumulusDemoApplication) written in Vue. Happy coding!
